# Darcy-Stokes
## Melt migration in convecting ice shell with differential motion

This repository has a 1D/2D/3D conservative finite difference solver using Discrete Operator approach. It was developed during my thesis research and also as a part of Marc's class "GEO 325M/398M Numerical Modeling in the Geosciences". (https://mhesse.github.io/numerical_modeling/)

This repository has all the codes in Matlab and Python that are developed as a part of Dr. Marc Hesse's course. The credit is due to Marc for providing the half complete Matlab codes as an exercise. The Python codes have been developed by me.

Moreover, the Darcy-Stokes codes have not been covered in the class and I have written codes for both Matlab and Python.
